The default installation options should work fine.\r     - After installing, make sure to close all instances of VS Code and other terminals (cmd, powershell, bash, etc)\r 3. Fork the repository\r 4. Clone your fork to your machine and open the folder in VS Code\r 5. Create a file called `index.js` in the `0. Hello World` folder\r 6. Type in `console.log(\"hello world)` in index.js and save the file\r 7. Open the terminal of VS Code. You will see that the terminal is currently in `IT114LM1W3-Introduction-to-JavaScript` but index.js is in the `0. Hello World` folder\r 8. Change the present working directory to `0. Hello World` by typing in `cd \"0. Hello World\"`\r     - The `cd` command means \"change directory\"\r     - Tip: terminals have an auto-complete feature. just type in `cd 0` then press tab to quickly enter the folder name starting with \"0\"\r 9. Now that you are in the folder where `index.js` is located, you may run `index.js` by typing in `node index.js` in the terminal. This will show `Hello World` in the terminal\r 10. Now that you are done with exercise 0, commit and push your changes\r 11. Change the present working directory of the terminal to the folder of exercise 1\r     1. You are currently in `0. Hello World` but `1. Variables, Data Types, and Operators` is in the parent directory\r     2. Move to the parent directory by entering `cd ..` in the terminal\r     3. Move to the directory of exercise 1 by entering `cd \"1. Variables, Data Types, and Operator\"` in the terminal. See the tip in one of the previous steps.\r 12. Start doing exercise 1. Once you're done with exercise 1, follow the same process for the other exercises",
